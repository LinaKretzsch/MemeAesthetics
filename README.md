# Application: Meme Aesthetics
Meme Aesthetics is a research project, exploring the aesthetic queues of memes from politically left- and right-oriented forums.

The project was created in a team of 3 within the framework of an arts-based research course. My 2 teammates used a GAN model to generate images based on a database of memes originating politically left- and right-oriented forums. My part was to create the website with CSS, HTML and JavaScript, to showcase the final computer-generated images in form of a guessing game. Once the user guesses whether the image grit is based on left- or right-wing oriented memes, the correct answer is displayed. Additionally, the background gradient of the website changes to represent the colors of the Canadian liberal or conservative party in order to indicate the political direction of the underlying data set.

I had initially created this applition using vanilla JavaScript and re-created it recently using React, since I have been teaching myself React in my free time.
